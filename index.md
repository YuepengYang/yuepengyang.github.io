## About Me

Starting July 2025, I am a postdoc at the Stat&DS department of Yale University, advised by Professors [Yuejie Chi](https://yuejiechi.github.io/) and [Yuxin Chen](https://yuxinchen2020.github.io/).

Previously, I obtained my PhD in Statistics in 2025 at the University of Chicago, advised by Professor [Cong Ma](https://congma1028.github.io/).
Before that I did a combined B.S. and M.S. in Mathematics at Carnegie Mellon University in 2020. My Master thesis was supervised by Professor [Dejan Slepcev](https://www.math.cmu.edu/~slepcev/).

I'm interested in all sorts of things related to stat/ML theory!
