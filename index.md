## About Me

I'm a fourth year Stat PhD student at the University of Chicago. I'm happy to be advised by Professor [Cong Ma](https://congma1028.github.io/). 
Before coming to UChicago, I did my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Mathematics at Carnegie Mellon University from 2016 to 2020. My Master thesis was supervised by Professor [Dejan Slepcev](https://www.math.cmu.edu/~slepcev/). 

I'm interested in all sorts of things related to theory/ML!
